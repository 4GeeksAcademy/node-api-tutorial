# `02` Installing Express

In this case, we are going to install **ExpressJS** which is the framework we are going to use to create our API.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Let's install express by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express --save-dev
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ We are using `--save-dev` in order to keep express as part of our project so from now on, it will take part of the dependencies that will be always installed.
